2015.04.06

  Fixes:
    - Who goes first changes!
    - It is believed (not 100% proven) that the player who goes first is the player with the highest:

    - Player with higher number now goes first
    - Demons/Thiefs need to have level 0 to be invulnerble and always go first.

        Ths needs to be verified.
