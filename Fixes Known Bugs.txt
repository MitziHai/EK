  Fixes:

        if <Add Cost> = 0 it will not display
        Examples of data entry:
          s o l;pyr5     will result in: Statue of Light;10;pyr5 
             Level 10 Statue of Light with prayer 5)
          s s;3;sg5      will result in: Serpant Shamanka;10;3;sg5 
             Level 10 Serpant Shamanka with Swamp Guard 5 and cost 18 (3 higher than base cost of 15)
          si s;3         will result in: Silver Swordmaster;3
             Level 3 Silver Swordmaster
          l p;15;res     will result in Light Paladin;15;res1

             Note deck cost is properly figured here at 20 based on level without entering additional cost

        2) Save the hydra event cards selected (see below)
    - I have created a series of decks files (Hydra, KW, Demons, Thiefs)
        If they do not exist they will be created for you (demons is loaded by default on first run)
    - In the settings screen you will find the ability to select the hydra event cards
        These are the cards that the players get as bonuses
     - A new option for hydra reseults 
        Shows how many iterations/attacks on average it will take kill a given hydra
     - Added all the hydra cards to the card list (buffed cards are entered with prefix H2, H3, H4 or H5)

  Known bugs
    - Snipe and Devils Blade not working as per EK for cards with same hp, but no one know proper algo 
    - Retaliation seems to activate in log after a dodge, but it DOESN'T DO DAMAGE!

  Possible Bugs Check these:
    - Find best deck may not work in new hydra mode
    - KW resets and buff/rune carry overs
    - if d_prayer or d_reanimation +qs_prayer brings player above 0 during opponents turn player continues to fight
    - mouse wheel occasionally ignored in lists
    - If a card with D:reanimation dies during a blizzard or other damage all attack does the card reanimated get hit by attack

2015.04.06

  Fixes:
    - Who goes first changes!
    - It is believed (not 100% proven) that the player who goes first is the player with the highest:

  Notes:
    - Show Kingdom War Results: For each run this will sim 1 time until player 1 dies 
      (so 1000 runs is simming 1000 lives for player 1). This can cause this mode to have very long sims!
  Known Bugs:
    - KW probably not resetting all cards and player info properly (arctic guard carry over for example)
    - Snipe and Devils Blade not working as per EK for cards with same hp, but no one know proper algo
    - Results tab doesn't make sense for KW and Arena Matches

    - Fixed error with QS:Teleport removing incorrect card from hand
